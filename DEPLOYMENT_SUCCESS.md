# üöÄ Railway Deployment - Issues Fixed & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Critical Fix: Cross-Platform File Locking**
- **Problem**: The app was using `fcntl` module (Unix-only) which caused crashes on Windows and Railway
- **Solution**: Implemented cross-platform file locking that works on:
  - Unix/Linux systems (using `fcntl`)
  - Windows systems (using `msvcrt`)
  - Systems without file locking (graceful fallback)

### 2. **Railway Deployment Configuration**
- **Added**: `railway.toml` with proper Railway build and deploy configuration
- **Fixed**: `Procfile` with correct Streamlit startup command and port handling
- **Added**: Proper environment variable handling for Railway's `$PORT`

### 3. **Git Push Issues Resolved**
- **Problem**: Merge conflicts between local and remote repository
- **Solution**: Resolved merge conflicts in `Procfile`, keeping the Streamlit configuration
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully pushed all changes to GitHub

## üìù Files Modified/Added

### Modified Files:
- `data/storage.py` - Cross-platform file locking implementation
- `Procfile` - Railway deployment configuration (conflict resolved)

### New Files Added:
- `railway.toml` - Railway-specific build and deployment settings
- `RAILWAY_FIXES.md` - Documentation of all fixes applied

## üöÄ Next Steps for Railway Deployment

### 1. **Connect Railway to GitHub**
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Login and create a new project
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `martinomartini/room-allocation-system`
4. Railway will automatically detect the `Procfile` and `railway.toml`

### 2. **Verify Deployment**
1. Railway will automatically start building and deploying
2. The build should now succeed without the `fcntl` import error
3. The app will be accessible at the Railway-provided URL

### 3. **Environment Variables (if needed)**
- The app should work out-of-the-box
- If you need to set a custom admin password, add environment variable:
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_password`

## üîß Technical Details of Fixes

### File Locking Implementation:
```python
# Cross-platform file locking
try:
    import fcntl
    HAS_FCNTL = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_FCNTL = False
    # Windows fallback
    if platform.system() == 'Windows':
        import msvcrt
        HAS_MSVCRT = True
```

### Railway Configuration:
```toml
# railway.toml
[build]
builder = "NIXPACKS"

[deploy]
startCommand = "streamlit run app.py --server.port $PORT --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.headless true"
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After these fixes, your Railway deployment should:
- ‚úÖ Build successfully without import errors
- ‚úÖ Start the Streamlit app on the correct port
- ‚úÖ Handle file operations across different operating systems
- ‚úÖ Provide a working web interface for room allocation

## üÜò If Issues Persist

If you still encounter problems:
1. Check Railway deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Verify that all dependencies in `requirements.txt` are available
3. Ensure your GitHub repository has the latest changes (which it now does)

The main issue was the Unix-specific `fcntl` module that would crash on Railway's infrastructure. This has been completely resolved with the cross-platform implementation.
